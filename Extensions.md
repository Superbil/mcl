This page lists a few of the many extensions to MCL. Many additional extensions are included in the [Examples](http://code.google.com/p/mcl/source/browse/#hg/examples) of the MCL distribution.

  * [AppleEvent Suites](http://in-progress.com/src/index) (Terje Norderhaug) - Makes MCL and its application scriptable and recordable by implementing the classes and event handlers of the standard AppleEvent suites. Provides a framework for adding customized suites to MCL applications.
  * [Breakpoints](http://www.clairvaux.org/Breakpoints.html) (Glen Foy) - adds breakpoint functionality to MCL's stepper tool.
  * [Closer to MOP](http://common-lisp.net/project/closer/) and ContextL (Pascal Costanza) - see the darcs repositories for MCL supported editions.
  * [Color Coded](http://www.clairvaux.org/ColorCoded.html) (Glen Foy) - lisp syntax styling for the MCL editor.

  * [Source Compare](http://www.clairvaux.org/SourceCompare.html) (Glen Foy) - GUI to a UNIX "diff" command for Lisp.
  * [Twist Down](http://code.google.com/p/mcl/source/browse/examples/twist-down.lisp) (Richard Lynch/Terje Norderhaug) - Displays a hierarchy in a manner similar to the traditional Finder's twist-down file browser.

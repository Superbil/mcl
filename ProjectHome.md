## News ##

May 13, 2011: The [MCLIDE](http://mclide.in-progress.com) Lisp IDE for Mac has an installer for MCL 6.

November 7, 2010: Preview of MCL 6.0 can be built from the sources.

Friday November 13, 2009: The [rmcl52-1 zip](http://mcl.googlecode.com/files/rmcl52-1_a498ea5438.zip) distribution of RMCL 5.2.1 based on [revision a498ea5438](http://code.google.com/p/mcl/source/detail?r=a498ea5438c63347c6634a3072e459b06f6a4ecc) fixes a number of issues reported for the previous RMCL 5.2 version.

October 9, 2009: The [rmcl52.zip](http://mcl.googlecode.com/files/rmcl52.zip) distribution of RMCL 5.2 for Intel and PPC replaces the previous rmcl52.dmg "rough build" announced on September 15. It differs from the previous in that the folder names and structure parallels MCL 5.2 (PPC only). The application itself also starts up without delay, as it is set to make a more reasonable initial memory allocation.

September 16, 2009: The [source for the RMCL 5.2 branch](http://code.google.com/p/mcl/source/browse/) is now open for development using [Mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/) for revision control. See the [Mercurial setup page](http://code.google.com/p/mcl/wiki/MercurialSetup) for instructions.

An [SVN archive](http://mcl.googlecode.com/svn/) with the original revision history is permanently available for future reference.
